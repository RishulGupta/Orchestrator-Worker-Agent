Overview
--------

This repository implements an **Orchestral Worker**, which acts as a central coordination agent within an agentic AI system. Its primary role is to oversee and manage a collection of autonomous agents, enabling them to collaboratively accomplish complex tasks.

An Orchestral Worker ensures that tasks are properly assigned, dependencies are resolved, progress is tracked, and final outputs are synthesized â€” much like a conductor leading an orchestra of agents.

Key Concepts
------------

- **Agentic AI**: A paradigm where autonomous agents, often powered by large language models (LLMs), collaborate to solve tasks.
- **Orchestral Worker**: The central controller or conductor agent that organizes and coordinates the other functional agents to execute a plan or process.

Responsibilities of the Orchestral Worker
-----------------------------------------

- Delegating tasks dynamically to various specialized agents.
- Managing the state and context of the ongoing workflow.
- Handling failures with retry or fallback mechanisms.
- Executing complex, multi-step goals by breaking them into subtasks.
- Collecting and integrating results from agents for final output.

Use Cases
---------

- Automated content generation pipelines
- Data analysis or report generation with multiple AI agents
- Research agents collaborating under a central manager
- Planning and execution flows in multi-agent environments
- CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen-style orchestrations

Technologies Used
-----------------

- Python
- LangChain
- LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4,etc.)
- State management with simple in-memory or persistent storage

Features
--------

- Modular agent registration and orchestration
- Stateless or stateful execution modes
- Support for step retries and error handling
- Extensible interface for custom agent behaviors
- Easily integratable with existing multi-agent frameworks

Getting Started
---------------

To run the orchestral worker:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/orchestral-worker.git
   cd orchestral-worker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main orchestration:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
